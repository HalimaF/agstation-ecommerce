# Image Upload Issues on Render

## The Problem

Your images are not persisting because Render uses **ephemeral file storage**. This means:

1. **Files disappear on restart/redeploy** - Every time your app restarts or you deploy new code, uploaded files are deleted
2. **Not suitable for production** - This is a common issue with containerized hosting platforms

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed image path issues** - Updated all image src paths to use absolute URLs (`/uploads/...` instead of `../uploads/...`)
✅ **Added file validation** - Only allows JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP images up to 5MB
✅ **Improved error handling** - Better error messages for file upload failures

## Solutions for Production

### Option 1: External Image Storage (Recommended)
Use a cloud storage service like:
- **Cloudinary** (easiest, has free tier)
- **AWS S3**
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **Azure Blob Storage**

### Option 2: Database Storage (Not Recommended)
Store images as BLOB in PostgreSQL (impacts performance)

### Option 3: Use Pre-uploaded Images
Upload images manually to a static hosting service and just store URLs

## Quick Fix for Testing

For immediate testing, you can:
1. Upload an image
2. Test functionality immediately (before app restarts)
3. Use sample images that are already in the codebase

## Implementation Priority

**For production deployment, implement Cloudinary integration as it:**
- Provides permanent storage
- Automatic image optimization
- CDN delivery
- Easy PHP integration
- Free tier available

Would you like me to implement Cloudinary integration?
